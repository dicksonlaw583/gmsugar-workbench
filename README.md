# GMSugar

Constructor utility scripts for GameMaker Studio (with test suite)

## Introduction

GMSugar provides an alternative syntactic sugar to replace GML's repetitive pattern of initializing data structures and other dynamically allocated types. With constructors instead of line-by-line setting calls, you can quickly build your data in a visually intuitive new way.

## Requirements

- GameMaker Studio 1.4 or above

## Contributing to GMSugar

This is the official GMS 1.x workbench for the library. Please make and test your changes here first.

- Clone both ```gmsugar``` and ```gmsugar-workbench```.
- Open the workbench in GameMaker Studio and make your additions/changes to the ```GMSugar``` script group. If possible, also add corresponding tests to the ```GMSugarTest``` script group.
- Use F5 to run the test suite. A successful run should exit on its own without any errors or popups.
- Export your additions in the ```GMSugar``` group to ```gmsugar```, one script at a time.
- Open a pull request on both ```gmsugar``` and ```gmsugar-workbench```.
